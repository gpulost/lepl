'''
Matchers form the basis of the library; they are used to define the grammar
and do the work of parsing the input.

A matcher is like a parser combinator - it takes a stream, matches content in
the stream, and returns a list of tokens and a new stream.  However, matchers
are also generators, so they can be "recalled" to return alternative matches.
This gives backtracking.

Matchers are implemented as both classes (these tend to be the basic building
blocks) and functions (these are typically "syntactic sugar").  I have used
the same syntax (capitalized names) for both to keep the API uniform.

For more background, please see the `manual <../manual/index.html>`_.

        **self[start:stop:direction, separator, ...]** - Repetition and lists.
        
        This is a complex statement that modifies the current matcher so
        that it matches several times.  A separator may be specified
        (eg for comma-separated lists) and the results may be combined with
        "+" (so repeated matching of characters would give a word).
        
        start:stop:direction
          This controls the number of matches made and the order in which
          different numbers of matches are returned.
          
          [start]
            Repeat exactly *start* times
            
          [start:stop]
            Repeat *start* to *stop* times (starting with as many matches
            as possible, and then decreasing as necessary).
            
          [start:stop:direction]
            Direction selects the algorithm for searching.  This is
            equivalent to a tree search because at each match we can
            either consume more of the stream (going deeper) or try
            an alternative matcher (by backtracking the sub-matcher)
            (going wider). 
            
            1
              A breadth first search is used, which guarantees that the
              number of matches returned will not decrease (ie will
              monotonically increase) on backtracking.  This tries all
              possible matches for the sub-matcher first (before repeating
              calls to consume more of the stream).
              
            0
              A depth first search is used, which tends to give longer
              matches before shorter ones.  This tries to repeats matches 
              with the sub-matcher, consuming as much of the stream as 
              possible, before backtracking to find alternative matchers.
              If the sub-matcher does not backtrack then this guarantees
              that the number of matches returned will not increase (ie will
              monotonically decrease) on backtracking.
              
            -1
              An exhaustive search is used, which finds all results (by 
              breadth first search) and orders them by length before returning 
              them ordered from longest to shortest.  This guarantees that
              the number of matches returned will not increase (ie will
              monotonically decrease) on backtracking.
            
          Values may be omitted; the defaults are: *start* = 0, *stop* = 
          infinity, *direction* = 0 (depth first search).

        separator
          If given, this must appear between repeated values.  Matched
          separators are returned as part of the result (unless, of course,
          they are implemented with a matcher that returns nothing).  If 
          *separator* is a string it is converted to a literal match.

        ...
          If ... (an ellipsis) is given then the results are joined together
          with "+".           

        Examples
        --------
        
        Any()[0:3,...] will match 3 or less characters, joining them
        together so that the result is a single string.
        
        Word()[:,','] will match a comma-separated list of words.
        
        value[:] or value[0:] or value[0::0] is a "greedy" match that,
        if value does not backtrack, is equivalent to the "*" in a regular
        expression.
        value[::1] is the "non-greedy" equivalent (preferring as short a 
        match as possible) and value[::-1] is greedy even when value does
        provide alternative matches on backtracking.

          direction
            In the presence of global backtracking, repeated matching can

            This parameter controls the sequence in which the matches are

            The algorithm is selected by an integer:
            
              1 (counts up)
                This selects a breadth first search of possible matches.
                The number of matches increases monotonically (ie. never gets
                smaller).
                
              0 (unpredictable, but tends to count down)
                This selects a depth first search of possible matches.
                In general, larger numbers of matches are found first, but
                it is possible for the number of matches to increase or
                decrease if the sub-matcher backtracks.
                
              -1 (counts down)
                This selects an exhaustive search whose results are then 
                ordered to guarantee that the number of matches decreases
                monotonically (ie never gets larger).
                
                **Warning**: This will recurse indefinitely (until the
